h1. Astra Flex Components

Originally created by Yahoo! Inc.
Forked by Josh Tynjala.

Since Yahoo! has no plans to update the Astra projects anymore (Source: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ydn-flash/message/2296), and the most recent release of the Flex components don't work in Flex 4, I decided to fork the project. As one of the original developers of Astra, I worked at Yahoo! from 2006-2008 and developed many of these components personally. As you can imagine, I know most of the source code rather well, and you can expect any changes I make to be of equal quality.

Please note: I have no long-term plans for maintaining or adding the Astra Flex components beyond making the existing code work in Flex 4. If you have feature requests or need a bug fixed, you may create an issue or vote on an existing one, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to respond promptly. Contributors are welcome.
